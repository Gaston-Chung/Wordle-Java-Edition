# ðŸ”¤ Wordle: Java Edition

Wordle: Java Edition is my own version of Wordle. I reverse-engineered the original game by myself and also made improvements to the base game.

For those who don't know: Wordle is a word guessing game where a mystery 5-letter long word is randomly chosen, and it's your job to figure out what it is. You enter other 5-letter words to see if your word and the mystery word have any letters in common. If there are common letters but they're not in the right place, those letters get highlighted in yellow. If they are in the right place, those letters get highlighted in green. You have 6 attempts to guess the word.

## ðŸŽ® Different Gamemodes

In addition to the Classic Wordle that everyone knows from the New York Times, I've also included 5 custom, unique gamemodes that I invented myself to enhance gameplay variety.

- **Reversed Wordle**: Features a completely different ruleset that will make guessing words harder than usual.
- **2-Player Wordle**: Face off against your friends to see who can set the hardest word for the other to guess.
- **Wordle Speed Blitz**: Figure out as many words as possible in just 5 minutes, where each incorrect guess shortens your time.
- **Endless Wordle**: See how far you can get by playing Classic Wordle over and over again until you can't guess the word anymore.
- **Endless Reversed Wordle** See how far you can get playing my harder variant.

## âœ… Improvements To The Base Game

-Added optional Hint Button that gives you a random letter you don't already have (If you don't want the help, you don't need to use it)
-All mystery words are guaranteed to be commonly used English words that everyone knows about (Preventing obscure words from being the answer)
-Removed profanity from the game (The original Wordle allows you to input profanity/swear words)
-You cannot re-enter words that you have already entered (So you can't submit the same word multiple times, which is pointless anyways)
